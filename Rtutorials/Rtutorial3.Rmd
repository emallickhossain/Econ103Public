This tutorial introduces how to do regression in R and then uses probability to
introduce other important aspects of R. Finally, the third part shows you how to 
import stock return data in R and introduces some related concepts and tools. 
Rather than appearing at the end, six exercises are scattered throughout the 
parts of this tutorial.


Regression in R
--------------------------------------------------------
### ``lm``
This command stands for "linear model" and is R's general purpose regression 
command. We're used to specifying a linear model as "y = a + bx" and ``lm``
uses a similar syntax. Basically, you'll specify ``lm(y ~ x)``. Let's do the regression
that we did in class of MPG and horsepower. Notice, in the ``lm`` command, you 
can specify the "data". If you didn't, you'd have to do "mtcars\$mpg" 
and "mtcars\$hp".
```{r}
library(data.table)
lm(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars)
```
Remember: unlike correlation and covariance, regression is *not symmetric*
```{r}
lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
```
Let's plot this relationship.
```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = mpg, y = hp, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
```

To add the regression line, we *follow* the plot command with the function 
``add_trace``, using the function ``coefficients`` with the ``lm`` command to 
extract the regression slope and intercept. The "%>%" lets you string together
multiple commands and continue to add onto the same chart instead of making a new one.
```{r}
regLine <- lm(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars)
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = mpg, y = hp, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", name = "data") %>% 
  add_trace(x = mpg, y = fitted(regLine), type = "lines", name = "regression")
```

Note that ``add_trace`` can only be used *after* you've already made a plot. 
It ``adds`` a line to the existing plot rather than making a plot of its own. 

You can also use ``add_trace`` to plot different kinds of lines. For example, 
we can show that the regression line goes through the means of the data. I added
some style options that made the "average" lines dashed instead of solid. The main
idea of this example is to get comfortable with the idea of plotting your data
 and then adding lines on top of the original plot. Unfortunately, Plotly does not
 have something like an ``hline`` or ``vline`` command so you acutally have to 
 specify the points that you are plotting. Slightly annoying, but managable.
```{r}
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = mpg, y = hp, type = "scatter" , mode = "markers", name = "Data") %>%
  add_trace(x = mpg, y = fitted(regLine), type = "lines", name = "Regression") %>%
  add_trace(x = c(min(mpg), max(mpg)), y = c(mean(hp), mean(hp)), mode = "lines", 
            line = list(dash = "5px"), name = "Average HP") %>%
  add_trace(x = c(mean(mpg), mean(mpg)), y = c(min(hp), max(hp)), mode = "lines", 
            line = list(dash = "5px"), name = "Average MPG")
```

### Exercise #1 - Regression
Carry out a linear regression in which ``qsec`` is the y-variable (this is the time
to go 1/4 mile) and ``wt`` is the x-variable (the weight of the car). Plot the 
data and add the regression line. Add dashed lines to show that the 
regression line goes through the means of the data. Interpret your results. 
Is there a relationship between quarter-mile time and car weight? Bonus: Can you 
make your dotted lines red? (Hint: you'll want to add ``color = "red"`` somewhere)
```{r echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.show='hide'}
#Exercise #1 - Regression
regLine <- lm(qsec ~ wt, data = mtcars)
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = wt, y = qsec, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", name = "Data") %>%
  add_trace(x = wt, y = fitted(regLine), type = "lines", name = "Regression") %>%
  add_trace(x = c(min(wt), max(wt)), y = c(mean(qsec), mean(qsec)), mode = "lines",
            line = list(dash = "5px", color = "red"), name = "Average Quarter-Mile Time") %>%
  add_trace(x = c(mean(wt), mean(wt)), y = c(min(qsec), max(qsec)), mode = "lines",
            line = list(dash = "5px", color = "red"), name = "Average Weight")
```

## Creating Your Own Functions

Functions take one or more inputs, called "arguments", and combine them in some 
way to produce an output. You've already met a great many of the built-in R 
functions. Now it's time to make some of our own. Making functions is a great 
way to save time by automating repetitive tasks and extend the functionality of 
R to make it even more useful. 

Writing a function would be the equivalent of writing an equation on your exam 
and then referencing it each time you compute 
something. If the function is specified properly, then you'll get full credit.
If your function is not correct, then you'll probably get wrong answers.

### Simple Example
R doesn't have a built-in function for computing z-scores, so we'll make one of 
our own. Among other things, this example will illustrate a key point about 
functions: you can build them out of *other functions* this means you don't have 
to re-invent the wheel each time you want to do something. To make our z-score 
function we'll use the built-in R functions ``mean`` and ``sd`` rather than 
writing our own mean and standard deviation functions from scratch:
```{r}
z.score <- function(x){
  z <- (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(z)
}
```
Let's walk through the above code one step at a time:

1. In R ``<-``, pronounced "gets" is the assignment operator, so ``z.score <-`` 
means that we're assigning something to ``z.score`` 
2. The thing we are assigning is indicated next: ``function``. So far we have 
``z.score <- function`` which means "R, I'm going to create a function and call 
it ``z.score``"
3. There are some parentheses next to ``function``. These are used to enclose 
the function's *arguments*. Argument is just another word for input. 
Functions can take one argument, more than one argument or no arguments 
depending on the situation, but you always need the parentheses. Here, 
``z.score <- function(x)`` means "R, I'm going to create a function called 
``z.score`` that takes a single argument whose name is ``x``."
4. The next thing we see is a curly bracket: ``{``. Essentially, a function is 
a set of *instructions* that tells R how to turn some arguments (inputs) into 
a desired output. These instructions are called the function *body* and they 
are always enclosed in curly brackets. If you look at the bottom of the function, 
you'll see the second curly bracket. A common mistake that people make is to 
forget the second bracket. *Always make sure to close any bracket that you open*.
5. Now we'll look at the function body, the list of commands contained inside of 
the curly brackets. The first part should be familiar: it's made up entirely of 
R commands that you already know! It does the following
  - Calculate the mean of the argument (input) ``x``. Ignore missing observations.
  - Calculate the standard deviation the argument (input) ``x``. Ignore missing observations.
  - Subtract the mean of ``x`` from the vector ``x`` and then divide by the standard deviation
  - Store the answer in a vector called ``z``
6. The last part of the function is the command ``return``. This indicates that 
our function should output or "return" the vector ``z``. In other words, ``z`` 
is the "answer".  

It was easy to create the ``z.score`` function because mathematical operations 
in R are *vectorized*. This means, for example, that if we want to add 3 to each 
element of a vector ``x``, we can just write ``x + 3``. In other words we don't 
have to *separately* add three to each element of ``x``. Similarly, if we want 
to add corresponding elements of ``x`` and ``y``, two vectors of the same length, 
we use ``x + y``. Try some simple examples of your own to make sure you understand 
how this works. See what happens if you try to add two vectors of *different* 
lengths. 

### Scope
Now, if you run your newly written function ``z.score`` and then run ``z`` to 
see the answer again, you will get an error ("Error: object 'z' not found""). We 
assigned the answer to ``z``, so why doesn't R know what ``z`` is?

There is something slightly subtle here: ``z`` is a variable "inside a function", 
namely a variable inside the function ``z.score``. This makes it different from 
the other variables that we've seen so far. To explain how, we'll need to 
introduce a programming concept called "scope."

Scope refers to where the variable "lives," meaning how it can be accessed. 
We will focus on two types of scope, *global* and *local*. 

If you type the command ls() into the R console (or look in the top right of RStudio), 
you will see a bunch of variables. These variables have "global scope". This 
means that they can be accessed from *anywhere* by *any function*. If you've run 
the code for the function ``z.score`` above, you'll see ``z.score`` when you 
type ``ls()`` into the console. This means that  ``z.score`` has global scope. 
Similarly if you type ``foo <- 3`` into the R console, ``foo`` will have global 
scope. You can see this by re-running ``ls()`` after you create ``foo``.

Notice, however, that you did *not* see ``z`` when you typed ``ls()``. This is 
because ``z`` is a "variable inside a function." In other words, it has 
*local scope*. This means that ``z`` is *only accessible inside* the function 
``z.score``.

Another example of a variable with local scope is the column of a dataframe, 
for example ``mpg`` in the dataframe ``mtcars``. We can only access 
``mpg`` by extracting it from ``mtcars``, which has global scope, 
using ``$``. 

**Don't worry if you don't immediately understand this. It's a weird concept to grasp.** 
You can think of variables with global scope like books on a shelf. You can see 
each one and pick it out. In contrast, variables with local scope are like 
*chapters* in a book: you don't know what the chapter is called until you open 
a specific book and read it. 

### Missing Observations
Before looking at more examples of functions, we need to learn a little more 
about missing values. As we've seen, many of the built-in R functions have 
optional arguments that you can use to direct R to ignore missing observations, 
for example ``na.rm = TRUE``. When you make your own functions from scratch, 
however, things are slightly trickier.

To handle this situation, we'll use a function called ``is.na`` 
that tests for missing observations:
```{r}
foo <- c(1, 3, NA, 3, 0, NA)
is.na(foo)
```
As you can see from the output, ``is.na`` returns a vector of *logical* 
(aka Boolean) values. A value of ``TRUE`` indicates that the corresponding 
element of ``foo`` is missing. In this case, the 3rd and 6th elements are 
``NA``s. On it's own, this isn't very useful, but it turns out we can use vectors 
of logical values to *select* desired elements of a vector or dataframe. 
One way of selecting the first and second element of foo is
```{r}
foo[1:2]
```
but here's another:
```{r}
foo[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```
When you select using a logical vector, it must have the *same length* as 
the vector you're selecting. Using this idea, we could select the *missing* 
observations of ``foo`` as follows:
```{r}
foo[is.na(foo)]
```
Now, what we'd really like to do is select all the observations that are 
*not* missing. It turns out that this is easy: the R symbol for NOT is the 
exclamation point (``!``) which is more commonly called "bang" by programmers. 
If you put this symbol in front of a vector of logical values, it 
turns ``TRUE`` into ``FALSE`` and ``FALSE`` into ``TRUE``:
```{r}
!is.na(foo)
```
Hence:  we can **select all non-missing values** of ``foo`` as follows:
```{r}
foo[!is.na(foo)]
```
and we can **remove all missing values from foo** by overwriting the original 
vector with the values selected in the previous command:
```{r}
foo <- foo[!is.na(foo)]
```

### Creating Your Own Mean Function
Let's look at another example: making a function to compute the sample mean. 
R has a perfectly good function for calculating means, as we've seen, so this 
is purely for illustrative purposes. I'll call this function ``mymean`` to 
distinguish it from the built-in R function:
```{r}
mymean <- function(x){
  x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  x.bar <- sum(x) / length(x)
  return(x.bar)
}
```
Again, I'll walk you through this one step-by-step:

1. ``mymean <- function(x)`` tells R to create a function that takes a single 
argument ``x`` and store it under the name ``mymean``
2. The curly braces ``{``  and ``}`` enclose the function *body*.
3. ``x <- x[!is.na(x)]`` *overwrites* ``x`` with a new vector containing all 
the elements of ``x`` that are *not* NAs. In other words, this removes missing 
observations. 
4. ``sum(x) / length(x)`` calculates the sample mean: summing up the observations 
and dividing by the number of observations. Notice that I did *not* use 
``na.rm = TRUE`` in the ``sum`` command. If I had used it, everything still 
would have worked but since I *already removed all the missing observations* 
in the line above, this wasn't necessary. 

Let's test out ``my.mean`` on some data and make sure it works. 
First we'll use R's built-in ``mean`` function:
```{r}
testData <- c(1, 3, 6, NA, 7, NA, NA, 8)
mean(testData, na.rm = TRUE)
```
and then we'll try ``mymean``
```{r}
mymean(testData)
```
It works! Now I'm going to show you a slightly different version of ``mymean`` 
which I'll call ``mymean2``. This one will *not* give the correct answer:
```{r}
mymean2 <- function(x){
  x.bar <- sum(x, na.rm = TRUE) / length(x)
  return(x.bar)
}
mymean2(testData)
```
The answer is too small! What's going on here? The problem has to do with how I 
handled missing observations. Rather than throwing them away, I told ``sum`` to 
ignore them. The problem is that ``length`` does *not* ignore them: it simply 
counts up the number of elements in a vector, regardless of whether they're 
``NA``s. In effect we have divided by the *wrong* value of $n$: the sum is being 
taken over all *non-missing* observations while the length is being computed 
over *all* observations.

It's worth comparing ``mymean2`` to ``z.score``, the first function I introduced 
above. In that example it was ok to use ``na.rm = TRUE`` to handle the missing 
observations since this argument was available for *both* the ``mean`` 
and ``sd`` functions, so we did not have to worry about any mismatches between
the data used in the numerator and the denominator. 

### Creating Your Own Variance Function
One more example before I set you loose to make your own function. Here's R 
code to create a function called ``myvar`` that calculates the sample variance. 
This function piggybacks on ``mymean`` from above. This is a **good thing**. 
We've already tested ``mymean`` and know that it works, so incorporating it 
into ``myvar`` is much better than starting from scratch. Again, note how we 
handle missing observations.
```{r}
myvar <- function(x){
  x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  s.squared <- sum((x - mymean(x))^2) / (length(x) - 1)
  return(s.squared)
}
```
We can test this against ``var`` to make sure it works:
```{r}
var(testData, na.rm = TRUE)
myvar(testData)
```
Looks good!


### Exercise #2
It turns out that R doesn't have a *built-in* function to calculate skewness. 
Your job is to write one. Remember the definition of skewness from lecture:
  $$\mbox{Skewness} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^3}{s^3}$$
where $s$ is the sample standard deviation. Call your function ``skew``. 
It should take one argument, a vector ``x``, and return the sample skewness of 
``x``. Make sure to handle missing values appropriately. Use the built-in R 
functions ``mean``, ``sum``, ``length`` and ``sd`` to construct your skewness 
function. Test your function out on ``testData``. 
```{r echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.show='hide'}
#Exercise #2 - Write a Function to Calculate Skewness
skew <- function(x){
  x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  numerator <- sum((x - mean(x))^3) / length(x)
  denominator <- sd(x)^3
  return(numerator/denominator)  
}
skew(testData)
```
It turns out that the "e1071" package you downloaded when setting up R does have
a function for skewness (appropriately called ``skewness``). Check that it lines
up with what you got.



### Returning a Dataframe
The examples we've seen so far have been very simple: functions that take one 
argument and return a single value. In fact, functions can take multiple values 
and return pretty much anything. First we'll look at an example of a function 
that returns more than a *dataframe*. This is a very flexible way of returning 
multiple values in a way that makes them easy to access
```{r}
summary.stats <- function(x){
  
  x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  sample.mean <- mean(x)
  std.dev  <- sd(x)
  
  out <- data.frame(sample.mean, std.dev)
  return(out)
}
results <- summary.stats(testData)
results
results$sample.mean
results$std.dev
```

### Multiple Arguments
Now we'll look at a function that takes multiple arguments: ``mycov``. This is 
essentially a stripped-down version of ``cov``, the built-in R equivalent. 
Unlike ``cov`` which can accept two vectors as arguments *or* a whole dataframe, 
our version will only accept two vectors as arguments: ``x`` and ``y``. 
Handling the missing observations is a bit more complicated in this situation: 
we need to drop any ``x`` for which there isn't a corresponding ``y`` and any 
``y`` for which there isn't a corresponding ``x``. This is because covariance 
is a measure of the *relationship* between ``x`` and ``y``. Accordingly, it is 
calculated using *pairs* of observations rather than *individual* observations. 
First I'll give you the code, then I'll explain the part that's different from 
what we did above: 
```{r}
mycov <- function(x, y){
  
  keep <- !is.na(x) & !is.na(y)
  x <- x[keep]
  y <- y[keep]
  
  n <- length(x)
  
  s.xy <- sum( (x - mean(x)) * (y - mean(y)) ) / (n - 1)
  return(s.xy)
  
}
```
Testing this, 
```{r}
cov(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp, use = "complete.obs")
mycov(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```
we see that it works. 

The tricky part of the above code was the definition of the logical vector 
``keep`` which has ``TRUE`` for every element of ``x`` and ``y`` that we'll 
use to calculate the covariance. The symbol ``&`` means *AND*, so the line 
``!is.na(x) & !is.na(y)`` tells R to find all the indices (which correspond 
to pairs) for which *neither* ``x`` *nor* ``y`` is missing. This may be a 
little confusing so here's a toy example: 
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 3)
y <- c(5, NA, 6, 0)
!is.na(x)
!is.na(y)
keep <- !is.na(x) & !is.na(y)
keep
x[keep]
y[keep]
```
Once we've defined ``keep``, everything is similar to what we've already seen 
above. We simply select those elements of ``x`` and ``y`` that we want to keep 
and overwrite the original vectors ``x`` and ``y``. Then we implement the 
formula for covariance.


### Exercise #3
Write a linear regression function called ``myreg``. It should 
take two arguments: vectors ``x`` and ``y`` which you may assume have the same 
length. It should return a dataframe with columns ``a`` for the intercept and 
``b`` for the slope. Make sure to handle missing values appropriately. Feel 
free to use any built-in R functions you like *except* ``lm``. Check your answer 
against the regression results for MPG and horsepower that we calculated above. 
When creating this function, remember that regression is *not* symmetric.
```{r echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.show='hide'}
#Exercise #3 - Write a Function to Carry Out Linear Regression
myreg <- function(y, x){
  
  keep <- !is.na(x) & !is.na(y)
  x <- x[keep]
  y <- y[keep]
  
  b <- cov(x,y) / var(x)
  a <- mean(y) - b * mean(x)
    
  out <- data.frame(a, b)
  return(out)
  
}
lm(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars)
myreg(y = mtcars$hp, x = mtcars$mpg)
```

## Stock Market Data
Now that we know how to write our own functions, let's have a little fun playing 
the stock market. It's easy to download and play with stock price data using the 
R packages ``Quandl`` and ``zoo``. An R package is like an "expansion pack" that 
gives R new features. One of the great things about R is that there literally 
thousands of packages that expand the usefulness of R. 


#### Installing ``Quandl``
First you'll need to install ``Quandl``. You only need to do this 
once: all subsequent times you can skip this part. In RStudio go to "Tools > Install Packages." 
The first time you do this, you may be asked to choose a "Repository." Don't 
worry about what this is, you can choose any of them. The package installation 
will just be slightly quicker if you choose a repository that's geographically 
close to Penn. (It's really just a question of which server you instruct R to 
download the packages from.) Make sure that the checkbox "install dependencies" 
is checked and then enter ``Quandl`` in the text box labeled "Packages". 
Lots of text will whiz past in the R console and once it finishes you'll have 
access to the desired packages.

If you don't like pointing and clicking, then just type the following into the 
console: ``install.packages("Quandl")``

Again, you don't need to repeat the proceeding steps each time you want to use 
``Quandl``. You do, however, need to *load* the packages every time 
you want to use them. (In other words, if you close RStudio you'll need to 
reload ``Quandl`` to use them.) Packages are loaded using the 
``library`` command.
```{r}
library(Quandl)
```
Now we're ready to get started.

#### Downloading Stock Prices
To start off I'll download prices for Apple stock:
```{r,cache=TRUE}
apple.prices <- Quandl('GOOG/NASDAQ_AAPL', start_date = '2012-01-01', 
                       end_date = '2012-12-31', type = 'raw')
```

Now I'll walk you through the arguments of the function ``Quandl``
  - The first argument is the *Quandl Code* for the data you want. In this case, 
  it happens that the code for Apple is ``GOOG/NASDAQ_APPL``. The ``GOOG`` 
  indicates that the data *source* is Google Finance and ``NASDAQ`` indicates 
  that we're looking for a company that's traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. 
  Finally, ``APPL`` is the ticker symbol for Apple Computer.
  - ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` mean exactly what you think they do.
  - ``type = 'raw'`` tells Quandl to set up our data without any special formatting. 
  Quandl has functionality to output data in various time series forms that can 
  then be used with other R packages.

You can look up the codes for various datasets on the Quandl website. Here are a few others for you to play with:
  - Stock Prices for Google: ``GOOG/NASDAQ_GOOG``
  - Stock Prices for Amazon: ``GOOG/NASDAQ_AMZN``
  - Stock Prices for Netflix: ``GOOG/NASDAQ_NFLX``
  - S&P 500 Index Prices: ``YAHOO/INDEX_GSPC``
  
All of these series are at the daily frequency.

#### Plotting Daily Stock Prices for Apple
Now let's take a look at what's contained in ``apple.prices``
```{r}
head(apple.prices)
```
As you can see, there's quite a lot of information here: for each day we have 
the opening price, the high price, the low price and the closing price. 
``Volume`` records how many shares were traded on that particular day.

We're mainly going to be interested in the closing prices, which we can plot by themselves as follows:
```{r}
plot_ly(data = apple.prices, x = Date, y = Close, type = "lines")
```

### From Prices to Returns
In financial economics, we're usually more interested in stock *returns* than 
stock *prices*. Returns measure the *percentage change* in a stock's price, so 
they tell us how much the value of our investment has grown (or declined). 
If $p_t$ is today's stock price and $p_{t-1}$ is yesterday's stock price, then
$$r_t = \frac{p_t - p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}}$$
is today's stock *return*. This is just the percentage change in price from 
yesterday to today *expressed as a decimal*. For example a return of $0.5$ 
corresponds to a 50% *increase* in the stock price and a return of $-0.05$ 
corresponds to a 5% *decrease* in the stock price.

#### Log Returns
As it happens, researchers in financial economics tend not to use the formula 
for *geometric returns* $r_t$ given in the previous section. Instead they work 
with something called *log returns* which is more convenient mathematically and 
very similar to geometric returns provided that $r_t$ isn't too large. The 
precise approximation is: $r_t \approx log(p_t) - log(p_{t-1})$ when $r_t$ is 
close to zero. In other words, we can approximate geometric returns by taking 
the *difference of the natural log of successive prices* rather than computing 
the ratio that defines $r_t$. The interpretation remains the same: a percentage 
change expressed as a decimal. 


**If you want to know more about log returns, there's an optional section at the end of this document explaining them in more detail.**


#### Log Returns for Apple
Now we'll construct daily log returns for Apple based on the closing prices. 
Remember: we need successive differences of the natural log of prices. The 
comand for successive differences in R is ``diff``, for example:
```{r}
foo <- c(1, 2, 4, 7, 11)
diff(foo)
```
since $2 - 1 = 1$, $4 - 2 = 2$, $7 - 4 = 3$ and $11 - 7 = 4$. We can combine 
this with the function ``log`` to compute log returns for Apple as follows:
```{r}
apple.returns <- diff(log(apple.prices$Close))
```

Plotting these, we have
```{r}
plot_ly(y = apple.returns)
```

Notice how different everything looks now! While the prices show a clear trend, 
the returns do not share this trend. They're much "spikier."" For those of you 
who know something about finance, this is often described by saying that prices 
follow a "random walk" while returns are "stationary." If you want to learn more 
about this, you should take Frank Diebold's undergrad course on forecasting.

#### Summary Statistics for Apple Returns
So what are the Apple's returns like? Could I make a fortune by owning this 
stock? The sample mean is a measure of *average* returns, which you can think 
of as the average "reward" for holding the stock
```{r}
mean(apple.returns)
```
While the sample standard deviation is a measure of the *variability* or *volatility* in returns 
```{r}
sd(apple.returns)
```
which you can think of as the "risk" of holding the stock. All things equal, 
you'd prefer a stock with high average returns and a low standard deviation.

Note that the preceding values are percentages *expressed as decimals*. To 
convert them into ordinary percents, we multiply by 100
```{r}
mean(apple.returns) * 100
sd(apple.returns) * 100
```
So, the average daily (log) return for Apple is -0.1% with a standard deviation 
of 1.8%. 

The nice thing about log returns is that to calculate cumulative returns over a 
period of time, you simply add up the daily log returns. For example, to get the 
cumulative log return for 2012 do the following:
```{r}
sum(apple.returns)
```
This means that if you'd started out holding $1 of Apple stock in January 2012, 
the value of your investment would have decreased to about $0.84 by the end of 
the year.

#### Are Apple Returns Skewed? 
A classic question in financial economics is whether stock returns are skewed. 
Let's have a look at Apple:
```{r}
plot_ly(x = apple.returns, type = "histogram") 
mean(apple.returns)
median(apple.returns)
```

### Exercise #4
Are Apple Returns Skewed? Test out your function for calculating skewness on 
``apple.returns`` and interpret your results.
```{r echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.show='hide',warning=FALSE}
#Exercise #4 - Are Apple Returns Skewed?
library(e1071)
skew(apple.returns)
skewness(apple.returns)
```



### Exercise #5
Download data for IBM (Quandl Code: GOOG/NYSE_IBM) and carry out the same 
analysis that we did for Apple Computer above. Use the same time period. 
Use your results to answer the following questions:
  1. Which has higher average returns over the period studied: Apple or IBM?
  2. Which are more "volatile" or "risky": IBM's returns or Apple's?
  3. If you had invested a dollar in IBM at the start of 2012, how much would 
  your investment have been worth at the end of the year?
  4. Are IBM returns skewed? How do they compare to Apple's returns in this sense?
  
```{r cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.show='hide',warning=FALSE}
#Exercise #5 - Repeat the Above for IBM Returns
ibm.prices <- Quandl("GOOG/NYSE_IBM", start_date = "2012-01-01", end_date = "2012-12-31", type = "raw")
head(ibm.prices)
plot_ly(data = ibm.prices, x = Date, y = Close, type = "lines")
ibm.returns <- diff(log(ibm.prices$Close))
plot_ly(y = ibm.returns)
mean(ibm.returns)
sd(ibm.returns)
sum(ibm.returns)
plot_ly(x = ibm.returns, type = "histogram")
mean(ibm.returns)
median(ibm.returns)
skew(ibm.returns)
skewness(ibm.returns)
```


### Exercise #6
In this exercise you'll calculate the *correlations* between different sets of 
returns.
  1. Calculate the sample correlation between Apple returns and IBM returns. 
  Intepret your result.
  2. Download price data for Bank of America stock (Quandl Code: GOOG/NYSE_BAC) 
  over the same period used for Apple and IBM and construct daily log returns 
  using closing prices.
  3. Calculate the correlation between Apple and Bank of American returns, and 
  Bank of America and IBM returns.
  4. Based on your answers to 1 and 3, which assets are most strongly correlated? 
  Which are least strongly correlated? If wanted to "hedge your bets", which of 
  these stocks would you choose to form a portfolio?
```{r cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.show='hide',warning=FALSE}
#Exercise #6 - Correlations between Returns
boa.prices <- Quandl("GOOG/NYSE_BAC", start_date = "2012-01-01", end_date = "2012-12-31", type = "raw")
boa.returns <- diff(log(boa.prices$Close))
cor(boa.returns, apple.returns)
cor(apple.returns, ibm.returns)
cor(boa.returns, ibm.returns)
```



### An Explanation of Log Returns (Optional)
You don't have to read this if you don't want to, and I'm not going to test you 
on it, but I suspect some of you may be curious about why log returns provide 
a good approximation of geometric returns and why summing log returns gives us 
cumulative returns. This section explains.

Recall the first-order Taylor Approximation from Calculus:

$$f(x) \approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0) (x - x_0)$$

In essence, this formula approximates an *arbitrary* differentiable function 
$f$ at a point $x$ by a *linear function* centered around a point of our own 
choosing, namely $x_0$. This is a good approximation *as long as $x$ is close to $x_0$*. To understand why, recall the definition of a derivative:

  $$f'(x_0) = \lim_{x \rightarrow x_0}\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x- x_0}$$
  
So if $x$ is "close enough" to $x_0$,

  $$f'(x_0) \approx \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x- x_0}$$
  
Rearranging this expression gives the Taylor Approximation. Now, consider the function $f(x) = log(1+x)$ where $log$ is the natural logarithm. Taylor expanding this around $x_0$ gives

  $$log(1+x) \approx  log(1+x_0) + \frac{1}{1+x_0} (x - x_0)$$
  
and the approximation is good when $x$ is close to $x_0$. We're free to choose any $x_0$ we want, so let's try $x_0 = 0$. Substituting, 

  $$log(1+x) \approx x$$
  
since $log(1)=0$. In other words, provided that $x$ is close to zero, $log(1+x)\approx x$. This is the approximation we'll use to motivate log returns. Now recall our definition of geometric returns from above:

$$r_t = \frac{p_{t}-p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}}$$ 

This is equivalent to 

$$r_t = \frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}}-1$$

Applying the approximation $log(1+x) \approx x$ to $r_t$ and using the properties of logarithms

$$r_t \approx log(1 + r_t) = log(1 + p_t/p_{t-1} - 1) = log(p_t/p_{t-1}) = log(p_t) - log(p_{t-1})$$

In other words, the difference of log prices is approximately equal to $r_t$, provided that $r_t$ is close to zero. This is true of daily stock returns.

Now, suppose we wanted to calculate cumulative returns over some period of time $t =1, 2,..., T$. For example, suppose that we have daily stock returns and want to find out what the overall return was over a year. I asserted above that when we're working with log returns, all we have to do is sum them. Here's an explanation. Consider the sum of log returns:

$$S = \sum_{t=1}^T log(1 + r_t) = log(1+r_1) + log(1+r_2) +\dots + log(1+R_{T-1})+ log(1+ r_T)$$

Since $log(1+r_t) = log(p_t) - log(p_{t-1})$, we have

$$S = log(p_1) - log(p_0) + log(p_2) - log(p_1) + \dots + log(p_{T-1}) - log(p_{T-2}) + log(p_T) - log(p_{T-1})$$

But notice how almost all of these terms cancel out! All that remains is:

$$S = log(p_T) - log(p_0)$$

which is just the difference of the log price at the end of the year and the log price at the beginning of the year! Now, using the properties of logarithms as above:

$$S = log(p_T/p_0) = log\left(1 + \frac{p_T - p_0}{p_0} \right)$$

Now we immediately recognize $(p_T - p_0)/p_0$: this is the cumulative geometric return over the whole year: the percentage change in price between date 0 and date $T$. Call this quantity $R_T$. We see that the sum of log returns, $S$ is related to $R_T$ as follows:

$$S = log(1 + R_T)\approx R_T$$

again using our approximation from above. Note that this approximation only works when $R_T$ is relatively close to zero. Since it is a percentage expressed as a decimal, as long as the horizon over which we calculate cumulative returns isn't too long this is a reasonable approximation. For example, a cumulative return of 20% over one year gives $R_T = 0.2$ which is reasonably close to zero. In contrast a 400% return over 15 years corresponds to $R_T = 4$ which is not close to zero. Hence, the trick of summing log returns to approximate cumulative geometric returns works well as long as we don't look at time periods that are too long or stocks that grew (or declined) too fast.
