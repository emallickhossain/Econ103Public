    To throw a total of 7 with a pair of dice, you have to get a 1 and a 6, or a 2 and a 5, or a 3 and a 4.
    To throw a total of 6 with a pair of dice, you have to get a 1 and a 5, or a 2 and a 4, or a 3 and 
    another 3.
	\vspace{1em}
	With two fair dice, you would expect:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item To throw 7 more frequently than 6.
		\item To throw six more frequently than 7.
		\item To throw 6 and 7 equally often.

\frametitle{How could we tell which are the real coin flips?}
    \begin{quote}
	Hardly anyone making up a sequence of 10 tosses puts in a run of 7 heads in a row. It is true that 
	the chance of getting 7 heads in a row with a fair coin is only 1/64. But in tossing a coin 100 times, 
	you have at least 93 chances to start tossing 7 heads in a row, because \alert{each of the first 93 
	tosses could begin a run of 7.} It is more probable than not, in 100 tosses, that you will get 7 
	heads in a row. It is certainly more probable than not, that you will get at least 6 heads in a row. 
	Yet almost no one writes down a pretend sequence, in which there are even 6 heads in a row.

\section{Tennis Tournament}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frametitle{A Fairly Ridiculous Example}

Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have agreed to play in a tennis tournament against six Penn professors. Each player in the tournament is randomly allocated to one of the eight rungs in the ladder (next slide). Federer always beats Djokovic and, naturally, either of the two pros always beats any of the professors. What is the probability that Djokovic gets second place in the tournament?
