	Hardly anyone making up a sequence of 10 tosses puts in a run of 7 heads in a row. It is true that 
	the chance of getting 7 heads in a row with a fair coin is only 1/64. But in tossing a coin 100 times, 
	you have at least 93 chances to start tossing 7 heads in a row, because \alert{each of the first 93 
	tosses could begin a run of 7.} It is more probable than not, in 100 tosses, that you will get 7 
	heads in a row. It is certainly more probable than not, that you will get at least 6 heads in a row. 
	Yet almost no one writes down a pretend sequence, in which there are even 6 heads in a row.

Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have agreed to play in a tennis tournament against six Penn professors. Each player in the tournament is randomly allocated to one of the eight rungs in the ladder (next slide). Federer always beats Djokovic and, naturally, either of the two pros always beats any of the professors. What is the probability that Djokovic gets second place in the tournament?

	You have been called to jury duty in a town where there are two taxi companies, Green Cab Ltd.\ 
	and Blue Taxi Inc. Blue taxi uses cars painted blue; Green Cabs uses green cars. Green cabs 
	dominates the market, with 85\% of the taxis on the road. On a misty winter night a taxi 
	sideswiped another car and drove off. A witness says it was a blue cab. The witness is tested 
	under conditions like those on the night of the accident, and 80\% of the time she correctly 
	reports the color of the cab that is seen. That is, regardless of whether she is shown a blue or a 
	green cab in misty evening light, she gets the color right 80\% of the time.

	You conclude, on the basis of this information:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item The probability that the sideswiper was blue is 0.8.
		\item It is more likely that the sideswiper was blue, but the probability is less than 0.8. 
		\item It is just as probable that the sideswiper was green as that it was blue.

	You are a physician. You think it is quite likely that one of your patients has strep throat, but you

	(like nearly all lab tests) not perfect. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the patient has strep throat, then 70\% if the time the lab says yes. But 30\% of the 
		time it says NO.
		\item If the patient does not have strep throat, then 90\% of the time the lab says NO. But 
		10\% of the time it says YES.
	\end{itemize}
	You send five successive swabs to the lab, from the same patient. and get back these results in 
	order: YES, NO, YES, NO, YES. You conclude:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item These results are worthless.
		\item It is likely that the patient does not have strep throat.
		\item It is slightly more likely that the patient has strep throat.
