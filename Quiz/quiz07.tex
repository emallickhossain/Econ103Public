        \item Have you turned in your exam corrections?
        \begin{itemize}
	        	\item The correct answer is ``Yes''
        \end{itemize}
        \item Have you turned in/emailed your R project summary?
   			\begin{itemize}
        		\item The correct answer is ``Yes.''
        \end{itemize}
        \item Do we have class next Wednesday?
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item The correct answer is ``No.''
        \end{itemize}
        \item When are office hours?
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item I will not have office hours the Tuesday or Wednesday of Thanksgiving week and no office hours on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving. To make up, I will hold office hours from 9-11 on Monday of Thanksgiving week to answer any questions you have before the holidays.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Have you answered the Piazza poll?
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item The correct answer is ``Yes''

		\item What is the distribution of $\bar{X}_n - \bar{Y}_m$ if we know the variances $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ and $X$ and $Y$ are normally distributed and independent of each other?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $N \left( \mu_X - \mu_Y, \frac{\sigma_X^2}{n} - \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{m} \right)$
			\end{itemize}			        
		\item What is the distribution of $\bar{X}_n - \bar{Y}_m$ if the variances are unknown, but $X$ and $Y$ are normally distributed and independent of each other?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Formally, this is a t-distribution. 
				\item As long as $m$ and $n$ are large enough, we can approximate with a Normal distribution. $N(\mu_X - \mu_Y, \frac{\S_X^2}{n} + \frac{\S_Y^2}{m})$

	    \item What is the distribution of $\bar{X}_n - \bar{Y}_m$ if the variances are unknown, and $X$ and $Y$ are from an unknown distribution and independent of each other?
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item The exact answer would depend upon the actual distribution of $X$ and $Y$, but we can use the Central Limit Theorem (assuming $m$ and $n$ are large enough) and approximate this by a Normal distribution
        	\end{itemize}
        	\item What is the distribution of $\bar{X}_n - \bar{Y}_m$ if the variances are unknown, and $X$ and $Y$ are from an unknown distribution?
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item We can approximate this with a normal distribution, but the variance is changed because of the dependence of the two populations. You must add in the $2Cov(\bar{X}, \bar{Y})$ term. 
        	\end{itemize}

        \item What is the best way to think about a sample proportion?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item It is the sample mean of a bunch of iid Bernoulli variables with probability $p$ of being one option and $1-p$ of being the other option.
            \end{itemize}
           \item If we cannot reject that two populations have the same mean, what value must be in our confidence interval for $\bar{X} - \bar{Y}$?
